Comment on Clarity

by Review #0:
The language is ok. The diagrams uses correct UML for domain modeling and it readable. Naming of classes are right.
by Review #1:
Language is totally fine layout is also pretty clear naming of classes absolutely follow the rules of thumb.
by Review #2:
A clear diagram, well structured and easy to be followed. Names are understandable and followed as it is in the requirements.
by Review #3:
Its too simple, maybe its not a correct domain modeling.

Considering the feedbacks I got, I tried to keep it as it’s.

Comment on Completeness

by Review #0:
You can remove the double arrows between such classes.
by Review #1:
There is one UML class diagram which is enough and it is a domain class diagram but it lacks the relation between two classes.
by Review #2:
In your model all the requirements for passing grade 2 are included which makes it a good model. Your model is a clear domain model where you avoided getting it mixed with software architect.
by Review #3:
missing attributes, so its not a correct domain class diagram.

Considering the feedbacks I got, I made some changes for the constructive and suggest changes; like removing double arrows(direction). In addition getting help form the course slides I used multiplicity when needed. I had idea to add some attributes for “Event” i.e, shortTitle, startDate and endDate but then decided not adding them and kept it simple like that. 

Comment on Content

by Review #0:
You can change some of the association name between classes such as has access to view.
by Review #1:
All classes needed are included, but it seems that not all requirements are presented. the model is focusing more on the problem understanding and three main parts of model are included the reservation of the berth has been presented , however the history did not handled in the model On the same side, membership fees also did not fixed in the model.
by Review #2:
According to the requirements, all the main concept are included and there was no unneeded classes. The way you create your model tells that you tried more to work on making it a problem understanding. Not including the treasure in the model is not completely correct if the treasure is considered as a user of the calendar and the events but it is still in my point of view should not be included.
by Review #3:
Missing some relationship, like boat related calendar...

Considering the feedbacks I got, I tried to change the name of the associations between classes i.e has access and contains. I didn’t add treasurer to my model because for my opinion, treasurer doesn’t have active role for the requirements for grade 2. In the end we agree on that with the reviewer #2. Lastly I couldn’t find a relationship between boat and calendar to show so kept it like that too.
